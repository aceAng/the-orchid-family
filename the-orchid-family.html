    <p>The <b>Orchidaceae</b> are a diverse and widespread family of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowering_plant">flowering plants</a>, with blooms that are often colourful and fragrant, commonly known as the <b>orchid family</b>.</p>

    <p>Along with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteraceae">Asteraceae</a>, they are one of the two largest families of flowering plants. The Orchidaceae have about 28,000 currently accepted species, distributed in about 763 genera. The determination of which family is larger is still under debate, because verified data on the members of such enormous families are continually in flux. Regardless, the number of orchid species nearly equals the number of bony fishes and is more than twice the number of bird species, and about four times the number of mammal species. The family also encompasses about 6â€“11% of all seed plants. The largest genera are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulbophyllum"><i>Bulbophyllum</i></a> (2,000 species), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidendrum"><i>Epidendrum</i></a> (1,500 species), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrobium"><i>Dendrobium</i></a> (1,400 species) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleurothallis"><i>Pleurothallis</i></a> (1,000 species).</p>

    <p>The family also includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla_(genus)"><i>Vanilla</i></a> (the genus of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla_planifolia">vanilla plant</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchis"><i>Orchis</i></a> (type genus), and many commonly cultivated plants such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalaenopsis"><i>Phalaenopsis</i></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattleya"><i>Cattleya</i></a>. Moreover, since the introduction of tropical species into cultivation in the 19th century, horticulturists have produced more than 100,000 hybrids and cultivars.</p>

    <p>Orchids are easily distinguished from other plants, as they share some very evident, shared derived characteristics, or "apomorphies". Among these are: bilateral symmetry of the flower (zygomorphism), many resupinate flowers, a nearly always highly modified petal (labellum), fused stamens and carpels, and extremely small seeds.</p>

    <p>Germinating seeds of the temperate orchid <i>Anacamptis coriophora</i>. The protocorm is the first organ that will develop into true roots and leaves.</p>

    <p>All orchids are perennial herbs that lack any permanent woody structure. They can grow according to two patterns:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Monopodial</b>: The stem grows from a single bud, leaves are added from the apex each year and the stem grows longer accordingly. The stem of orchids with a monopodial growth can reach several metres in length, as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanda"><i>Vanda</i></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla_(genus)"><i>Vanilla</i>.</li></a>
      <li><b>Sympodial</b>: Sympodial orchids have a front (the newest growth) and a back (the oldest growth). The plant produces a series of adjacent shoots which grow to a certain size, bloom and then stop growing and are replaced. Sympodial orchids grow laterally rather than vertically, following the surface of their support. The growth continues by development of new leads, with their own leaves and roots, sprouting from or next to those of the previous year, as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattleya"><i>Cattleya</i></a>. While a new lead is developing, the rhizome may start its growth again from a so-called 'eye', an undeveloped bud, thereby branching. Sympodial orchids may have visible pseudobulbs joined by a <i>rhizome</i>, which creeps along the top or just beneath the soil.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><i>Anacamptis lactea</i> showing the two tubers</p>

    <p>Terrestrial orchids may be rhizomatous or form corms or tubers. The root caps of terrestrial orchids are smooth and white.</p>

    <p>Some sympodial terrestrial orchids, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchis"><i>Orchis</i></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophrys"><i>Ophrys</i></a>, have two subterranean tuberous roots. One is used as a food reserve for wintry periods, and provides for the development of the other one, from which visible growth develops.</p>

    <p>In warm and constantly humid climates, many terrestrial orchids do not need pseudobulbs.</p>

    <p>Epiphytic orchids, those that grow upon a support, have modified aerial roots that can sometimes be a few meters long. In the older parts of the roots, a modified spongy epidermis, called velamen, has the function to absorb humidity. It is made of dead cells and can have a silvery-grey, white or brown appearance. In some orchids, the velamen includes spongy and fibrous bodies near the passage cells, called tilosomes.</p>

    <p>The cells of the root epidermis grow at a right angle to the axis of the root to allow them to get a firm grasp on their support. Nutrients for epiphytic orchids mainly come from mineral dust, organic detritus, animal droppings and other substances collecting among on their supporting surfaces.</p>

    <p>The base of the stem of sympodial epiphytes, or in some species essentially the entire stem, may be thickened to form a pseudobulb that contains nutrients and water for drier periods.</p>

    <p>The pseudobulb has a smooth surface with lengthwise grooves, and can have different shapes, often conical or oblong. Its size is very variable; in some small species of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulbophyllum"><i>Bulbophyllum</i></a>, it is no longer than two millimeters, while in the largest orchid in the world, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatophyllum_speciosum"><i>Grammatophyllum speciosum</i></a> (giant orchid), it can reach three meters. Some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrobium"><i>Dendrobium</i></a> species have long, canelike pseudobulbs with short, rounded leaves over the whole length; some other orchids have hidden or extremely small pseudobulbs, completely included inside the leaves.</p>

    <p>With ageing, the pseudobulb sheds its leaves and becomes dormant. At this stage, it is often called a backbulb. Backbulbs still hold nutrition for the plant, but then a pseudobulb usually takes over, exploiting the last reserves accumulated in the backbulb, which eventually dies off, too. A pseudobulb typically lives for about five years. Orchids without noticeable pseudobulbs are also said to have growths, an individual component of a sympodial plant.</p>
