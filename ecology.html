    <p>A majority of orchids are perennial epiphytes, which grow anchored to trees or shrubs in the tropics and subtropics. Species such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angraecum"><i>Angraecum sororium</i></a> are lithophytes, growing on rocks or very rocky soil. Other orchids (including the majority of temperate Orchidaceae) are terrestrial and can be found in habitat areas such as grasslands or forest.</p>
    <p>Some orchids, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neottia"><i>Neottia</i></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corallorhiza"><i>Corallorhiza</i></a>, lack chlorophyll, so are unable to photosynthesise. Instead, these species obtain energy and nutrients by parasitising soil fungi through the formation of orchid mycorrhizas. The fungi involved include those that form ectomycorrhizas with trees and other woody plants, parasites such as <i>Armillaria</i>, and saprotrophs. These orchids are known as myco-heterotrophs, but were formerly (incorrectly) described as saprophytes as it was believed they gained their nutrition by breaking down organic matter. While only a few species are achlorophyllous holoparasites, all orchids are myco-heterotrophic during germination and seedling growth, and even photosynthetic adult plants may continue to obtain carbon from their mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
