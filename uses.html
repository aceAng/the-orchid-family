    <p>The scent of orchids is frequently analysed by perfumers (using headspace technology and gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry) to identify potential fragrance chemicals.</p>

    <p>The other important use of orchids is their cultivation for the enjoyment of the flowers. Most cultivated orchids are tropical or subtropical, but quite a few which grow in colder climates can be found on the market. Temperate species available at nurseries include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophrys_apifera"><i>Ophrys apifera</i></a> (bee orchid), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnadenia_conopsea"><i>Gymnadenia conopsea</i></a> (fragrant orchid), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anacamptis_pyramidalis"><i>Anacamptis pyramidalis</i></a> (pyramidal orchid) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dactylorhiza_fuchsii"></a> <i></i>Dactylorhiza fuchsii (common spotted orchid).</p>
    <p>Orchids of all types have also often been sought by collectors of both species and hybrids. Many hundreds of societies and clubs worldwide have been established. These can be small, local clubs, or larger, national organisations such as the American Orchid Society. Both serve to encourage cultivation and collection of orchids, but some go further by concentrating on conservation or research.</p>
    <p>The term "botanical orchid" loosely denotes those small-flowered, tropical orchids belonging to several genera that do not fit into the "florist" orchid category. A few of these genera contain enormous numbers of species. Some, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleurothallis"><i>Pleurothallis</i></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulbophyllum"><i>Bulbophyllum</i></a>, contain approximately 1700 and 2000 species, respectively, and are often extremely vegetatively diverse. The primary use of the term is among orchid hobbyists wishing to describe unusual species they grow, though it is also used to distinguish naturally occurring orchid species from horticulturally created hybrids.</p>
    <p>New orchids are registered with the International Orchid Register, maintained by the Royal Horticultural Society.</p>

    <p>The dried seed pods of one orchid genus, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla_(genus)"><i>Vanilla</i></a> (especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla_planifolia"><i>Vanilla planifolia</i></a>), are commercially important as a flavouring in baking, for perfume manufacture and aromatherapy.</p>
    <p>The underground tubers of terrestrial orchids [mainly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchis_mascula"><i>Orchis mascula</i></a> (early purple orchid)] are ground to a powder and used for cooking, such as in the hot beverage salep or in the Turkish frozen treat dondurma. The name salep has been claimed to come from the Arabic expression <i>ḥasyu al-tha`lab</i>, "fox testicles", but it appears more likely the name comes directly from the Arabic name <i>saḥlab</i>. The similarity in appearance to testes naturally accounts for salep being considered an aphrodisiac.</p>
    <p>The dried leaves of <i>Jumellea fragrans</i> are used to flavour rum on Reunion Island.</p>
    <p>Some saprophytic orchid species of the group <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrodia"><i>Gastrodia</i></a> produce potato-like tubers and were consumed as food by native peoples in Australia and can be successfully cultivated, notably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrodia_sesamoides"><i>Gastrodia sesamoides</i></a>. Wild stands of these plants can still be found in the same areas as early aboriginal settlements, such as Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park in Australia. Aboriginal peoples located the plants in habitat by observing where bandicoots had scratched in search of the tubers after detecting the plants underground by scent.</p>

    <!-- Uses: Traditional medicinal uses -->
    <h3 id="Traditional-medicinal-uses">Traditional medicinal uses</h3>
    <p>Orchids have been used in traditional medicine in an effort to treat many diseases and ailments. They have been used as a source of herbal remedies in China since 2800 BC. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrodia_elata"><i>Gastrodia elata</i></a> is one of the three orchids listed in the earliest known Chinese Materia Medica (Shennon bencaojing) (c. 100 AD). Theophrastus mentions orchids in his Enquiry into Plants (372–286 BC).</p>
